title:      "Reading 11: File Systems"
body:       |

    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will begin our exploration of [file systems] and in
    particular the venerable [FFS] and [LFS].  Afterwards, we will follow this
    up with a discussion on how to enforce **consistency** in [file systems]
    and how to maintain **data integrity**.

    <div class="alert info-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "book" | embed_icon }}</i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to read about [file systems] and
    maintaining consistency and integrity in [file systems], and submit your
    responses to the [Reading 11 Quiz].

    ### Optional AI Conversation

    Using [Learn About from Google] (*or your preferred AI agent*), have a
    conversation about [file systems], [FFS], [LFS], **consistency**, and **data
    integrity** by asking the following questions:

    > 1. Why does the unix file system have a superblock?
    > 2. How does a file system store metadata?
    > 3. What is an indirect block in the context of a file system?
    > 4. How does FFS compare to the traditional unix file system?
    > 5. How does LFS compare to the traditional unix file system?

    > 6. How does a traditional unix file system maintain consistency?
    > 7. What does the fsck utility do?
    > 8. How does journaling help with file system consistency?
    > 9. How does a file system maintain data integrity?
    > 10. Is crash consistency the same thing as data integrity?

    As you explore, feel free to dive into the suggested related
    questions.

    ## Quiz

    Once you have done the readings, answer the following [Reading 11 Quiz]
    questions:

    <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

    <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>

    ## Program

    For this week, you are to take your `program` from [Reading 02] and modify
    it so that it supports **directories** as arguments.

    The standard [sha1sum] does not understand **directories**:

        :::bash
        $ sha1sum .
        sha1sum: .: Is a directory

    Your `program`, however, should *recursively* walk any directories given to
    it as an argument and check the files (and directories) with in the given
    folder:

        :::bash
        # Compute checksum on Makefile, current directory, and non-existent file
        $ ./program Makefile . asdf
        6e63c0859f0dfc9bf56996ae593ca048b809fc27  Makefile
        6e63c0859f0dfc9bf56996ae593ca048b809fc27  ./Makefile
        8cb3fa236aa278e3557f962e156f2358bd8e6c24  ./README.md
        3e43745ae7f331f11a8102f47a74043f27539e1e  ./program
        8c53ff3421b9ed6bca45d866e1b8add47e63bdfa  ./answers.json
        f51db4f87ed1d34124cb92c7be1c932546f652f4  ./program.c
        7ec632ad54439235effa874731326fb82ce31d00  ./test_program.sh

        $ echo $?
        1

    [sha1sum]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sha1sum.1.html

    ### Requirements

    - Your program must compile cleanly with no warnings.

    - Your program may only use I/O system calls such as [open], [read], and
      [close] to access the contents of each file.

    - Your program must use the [EVP_MD_CTX_new], [EVP_DigestInit_ex],
      [EVP_DigestUpdate], and [EVP_DigestFinal_ex] functions provided by
      [OpenSSL].

    - Your program must use file system functions such as [opendir], [readdir],
      and [closedir], and use file system calls such as [stat].

    - Your program must not have any resource leaks or memory errors as
      detected by [valgrind].

    [opendir]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/opendir.3.html
    [readdir]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir.3.html
    [closedir]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/closedir.3.html
    [stat]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html

    [EVP_MD_CTX_new]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestInit_ex]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestUpdate]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestFinal_ex]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/

    [open]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html
    [read]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html
    [close]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html
    [OpenSSL]:  https://www.openssl.org/
    [valgrind]: https://www.valgrind.org/

    ### Hints

    To handle directories as arguments, you can structure your program as
    follows:

        :::python
        cksum_file(path):
            if sha1sum_file(path, cksum):
                print(...)
                return 0

            return 1

        cksum_directory(root):
            for each entry in root directory:
                if entry in ('.', '..'):
                    continue

                if entry is directory:
                    status += cksum_directory(full path of entry)
                else:
                    status += cksum_file(full path of entry)

            return status

        main:
            for each argument:
                if argument is directory:
                    status += cksum_directory(argument)
                else:
                    status += cksum_file(argument)

            return status


    - In `main`, you can use [stat] to check the type of the argument.

    - In `cksum_directory`, you can use [sprintf] to build the full path of
      each `entry`.

    If you do not remember how to programmatically manipulate the file system,
    I recommend the following resources:

    1. [Files and Directories](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-intro.pdf)
