body:   |

    **Everyone**:

    This week, we will review [system calls], which are the interfaces through
    which user applications can request services from the operating system
    kernel.  Instead of manipulating data directly on a hard drive or directly
    controlling a CPU, we use the **abstractions** of a *file* and *process* to
    perform our desired actions.  The OS *virtualizes* the physical resources
    of a hard drive and a CPU and allows us to access these *virtual* objects
    through [system calls] such as [open] and [fork].

    These abstractions make it easier for us to program large applications by
    hiding the low-level details of interacting with hardware and by allowing
    our programs to be portable to different machines.  Of course, with any
    layer of abstraction there is some **trade-off**, and this week we will
    examine how operating systems virtualize the CPU via [processes] and how
    the operating system provides [time sharing], different forms of
    [multitasking], and what happens during a [context switch].

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "book" | embed_icon }}</i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to review basic [system calls] related
    to [processes], submit your responses to the [Reading 02 Quiz], and write a
    program that uses basic [file] system calls.

    ### Optional AI Conversation

    Using [Learn About from Google] (*or your preferred AI agent*), have a
    conversation using the following prompts:

    > 1. Explain what happens when a process is created on a unix system.

    > 2. Describe the different states a process can be in on a unix system.

    > 3. Summarize what happens during a system call.

    ## Program

    For this week's program, you are to modify the `program.c` to implement a
    basic version of the [sha1sum] utility:

    > Usage: program [file1 file2 ...]
    >
    > For each argument given to `program`, compute the [SHA1] digest of
    > the contents of each file argument and display it.

    The purpose of this exercise is for you to review using basic I/O [system
    calls] such as [open], [read], and [close].  If you need a refresher, please
    read [Files and
    Directories](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-intro.pdf) from the
    course textbook.

    ### Example

        :::bash
        $ ./program Makefile  # Compute SHA1 of Makefile
        e0b1114fd6dc86b34c1e3c7bf3a9f71757c55cae  Makefile

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        0

        $ ./program asdf      # Handle invalid files
        Unable to compute checksum for asdf

        $ echo $?             # Check exit status
        1

    ### Requirements

    - Your program must compile cleanly with no warnings.

    - Your program may only use I/O system calls such as [open], [read], and
      [close] to access the contents of each file.

    - Your program must use the [EVP_MD_CTX_new], [EVP_DigestInit_ex],
      [EVP_DigestUpdate], and [EVP_DigestFinal_ex] functions provided by
      [OpenSSL].

    - Your program must not have any resource leaks or memory errors as
      detected by [valgrind].

    <div class="alert danger-bg" markdown="1">
    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "bug" | embed_icon }}</i> Error Checking

    Make sure you always perform **error checking** for [system calls] (ie.
    [open]) and functions (ie. [malloc]) that could fail.
    </div>

    Note, we are interested in computing the [SHA1] digest.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "alert" | embed_icon }}</i> OpenSSL Deprecation

    Note that in [OpenSSL] 3.0, the `SHA1_Init`, `SHA1_Update`, and
    `SHA1_Final` functions are deprecated and you should instead use the
    [EVP_DigestInit_ex], [EVP_DigestUpdate], and [EVP_DigestFinal_ex] functions
    to compute the raw [SHA1] digest of a buffer of bytes.

    </div>

    [EVP_MD_CTX_new]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestInit_ex]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestUpdate]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/
    [EVP_DigestFinal_ex]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.3/man3/EVP_DigestInit/

    You will want your code to be structured in the following manner:

        :::text
        function sha1sum_file(path: string, cksum: string) -> bool:
            Open file for reading (open)

            Create and initialize context (EVP_MD_CTX_new)

            Read data from file into data buffer and update context (read, EVP_DigestUpdate)

            Compute raw SHA1 digest of data in buffer (EVP_DigestFinal_ex)

            Convert raw SHA1 digest into hexadecimal cksum

            Close file

            Deallocate context

        function main(arguments):
            For each argument:
                Compute hexadecimal SHA1 Digest using sha1sum_file
                Display hexadecimal SHA1 Digest


    To convert the raw [SHA1] digest into a **hexadecimal cksum**, you can use
    the following code snippet:

        :::c
        /* Convert raw SHA1 digest into hexadecimal cksum */
        for (int b = 0; b < SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH; b++) {
            snprintf(cksum + 2*b, 3, "%02x", digest[b]);
        }

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">

    **Note**: To link properly to the [OpenSSL] functions, you will need to add
      `-lcrypto` to the `LIBS` variable in your `Makefile`.

    </div>

    <div class="alert danger-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: You will want to return `0` if all arguments were able to be processed
    successfully.  Otherwise, return the **number of files that failed** as the
    **exit status**.
    </div>
