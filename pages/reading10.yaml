title:      "Reading 10: I/O Devices, RAID"
body:       |

    **Everyone**:

    Next week, we will explore how an OS provides **persistence** by managing
    [I/O devices] such as [hard disks].  Likewise, we will also consider
    aggregation strategies such as [RAID] which provide an illusion of a large
    disk composed of multiple inexpensive disks.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "book" | embed_icon }}</i> TL;DR

    For this reading assignment, you are to read about [I/O devices] and
    [RAID], and submit your responses to the [Reading 10 Quiz].

    ### Optional Reading

    - [An Introduction to RAID Terminology and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-raid-terminology-and-concepts)

    - [Understanding RAID: How performance scales from one disk to eight](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/understanding-raid-how-performance-scales-from-one-disk-to-eight/)

    ### Optional AI Conversation

    Using [Learn About from Google] (*or your preferred AI agent*), have a
    conversation about [I/O devices] and [RAID] by asking the following questions:

    > 1. What is the memory hierarchy?
    > 2. How do operating systems provide persistence?
    > 3. What is the difference between a SSD and a HDD?
    > 4. What is RAID and why is it useful?
    > 5. What is the difference between RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10?

    As you explore, feel free to dive into the suggested related questions.

    ## Quiz

    Once you have done the readings, answer the following [Reading 10 Quiz]
    questions:

    <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

    <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

    <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>

    ### Program

    For this week, you are to explore the filesystems on
    **student05.cse.nd.edu** by using [df], [lsblk], [mount], [stat], and
    `/proc/mdstat` to answer the following questions:

    1. What device is the root (ie. `/`) filesystem mounted on (ie. `/dev/XXX`)?

    2. What type of filesystem is `/boot` mounted on?

    3. What version of [RAID] does `/home` use (ie. `raidX`)?

    4. How large is each **swap** partition (in `G` units)?

    5. What is the **inode** number of `/etc/hosts`?

    6. What is the file size (in bytes) of `/bin/ls`)?

    In your `program.c`, simply use puts to print out the answers:

        :::c
        int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
            puts("/dev/...");
            ...
            puts("1");
            return 0;
        }
