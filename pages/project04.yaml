    <div class="flex-col" markdown="1">

    The last project is to build a *simplified* version of the [Unix File
    System] called **SimpleFS** as shown to the right.

    In this application, we have three components:

    1. **Shell**: The first component is a simple shell application that allows
    the user to perform operations on the **SimpleFS** such as printing
    debugging information about the file system, formatting a new file system,
    mounting a file system, creating files, and copying data in or out of the
    file system.  To do this, it will translate these user commands into **file
    system** operations such as `fs_debug`, `fs_format`, `fs_create`,
    `fs_remove`, `fs_stat`, `fs_read`, and `fs_write`.

    2. **File System**: The second component takes the operations specified by
    the user through the **shell** and performs them on the **SimpleFS** disk
    image.  This component is charged with organizing the on-disk data
    structures and performing all the bookkeeping necessary to allow for
    persistent storage of data.  To store the data, it will need to interact
    with the **disk emulator** via functions such as `disk_read` and
    `disk_write`, which allow the file system read and write to the disk image
    in `4096` byte blocks.

    3. **Disk Emulator**: The third component emulates a disk by dividing a
    normal file (called a **disk image**) into `4096 byte` blocks and only
    allows the **File System** to read and write in terms of blocks.  This
    emulator will persistently store the data to the disk image using the
    normal [open], [read], and [write] system calls.

    The **shell** component is provided to you.  You will have to complete both
    the **file system** and **disk emulator** portion of the application for
    this project.

    Working **individually** or in **pairs**, you are to create a **library**
    that implements the `Disk` and `FileSystem` components described above by
    **midnight** on **Wednesday, December 10, 2025**.

    ## Overview

    To implement the **file system** component, you will first need to
    understand the **SimpleFS** disk layout.  As noted previously, this project
    assumes that each disk block is `4KB` in size. The first block of the disk
    is the **superblock** that describes the layout of the rest of the
    filesystem. A certain number of blocks following the superblock contain
    inode data structures (ie. the **inode table**). Typically, **ten percent**
    of the total number of disk blocks are used as **inode** blocks (i.e.
    blocks reserved for storing the **inode table**).  The remaining blocks in
    the filesystem are used as plain **data** blocks, and occasionally as
    **indirect** pointer blocks as shown in the example below:

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="static/img/project04-layout.png" class="responsive">
    </div>

    In this example, we have a **SimpleFS** disk image that begins with a
    **superblock**.  This **superblock** consists of four fields:

    1. **Magic**: The first field is always the `MAGIC_NUMBER` or `0xf0f03410`.
    The format routine places this number into the very first bytes of the
    **superblock** as a sort of filesystem "signature".  When the filesystem is
    mounted, the OS looks for this magic number. If it is correct, then the
    disk is assumed to contain a valid filesystem. If some other number is
    present, then the mount fails, perhaps because the disk is not formatted or
    contains some other kind of data.

    2. **Blocks**: The second field is the total number of blocks, which should
    be the same as the number of blocks on the disk.

    3. **InodeBlocks**: The third field is the number of blocks set aside for
    storing **inodes**.  The format routine is responsible for choosing this
    value, which should always be `10%` of the **Blocks**, rounding up.

    4. **Inodes**: The fourth field is the total number of **inodes** in those
    **inode blocks**.

    <div class="alert caution-bg" markdown="1">
    Note that the **superblock** data structure is quite small: only `16`
    bytes.  The remainder of disk block zero is left unusued.
    </div>

    Each **inode** in **SimpleFS** looks like the file:

    <div class="centered">
      <img src="static/img/project04-inode.png" class="responsive">
    </div>

    Each field of the **inode** is a `4`-byte (`32`-bit) integer. The `Valid`
    field is `1` if the **inode** is valid (i.e. has been created) and is `0`
    otherwise.  The `Size` field contains the logical size of the **inode**
    data in bytes. There are `5` direct pointers to data blocks, and one
    pointer to an **indirect** data block. In this context, "pointer" simply
    means the number of a block where data may be found. A value of `0` may be
    used to indicate a *null* block pointer. Each inode occupies `32` bytes, so
    there are `128` inodes in each `4KB` inode block.

    Note that an **indirect** data block is just a big array of pointers to
    further data blocks. Each pointer is a `4`-byte int, and each block is
    `4KB`, so there are `1024` pointers per block. The data blocks are simply
    `4KB` of raw data.

    One thing missing in **SimpleFS** is the free block bitmap.  As discussed
    in class, a real filesystem would keep a free block bitmap on disk,
    recording one bit for each block that was available or in use.  This bitmap
    would be consulted and updated every time the filesystem needed to add or
    remove a data block from an inode.

    Because **SimpleFS** does not store this on-disk, you are required to keep
    a **free block bitmap** in memory. That is, there must be an array of
    **booleans**, one for each block of the disk, noting whether the block is
    in use or available. When it is necessary to allocate a new block for a
    file, the system must scan through the array to locate an available block.
    When a block is freed, it likewise must be marked in the bitmap.

    Suppose that the user makes some changes to a **SimpleFS** filesystem, and
    then reboots the system (ie. restarts the shell). Without a free block
    bitmap, **SimpleFS** cannot tell which blocks are in use and which are
    free.  Fortunately, this information can be recovered by scanning the disk.
    Each time that an **SimpleFS** filesystem is mounted, the system must build
    a new free block bitmap from scratch by scanning through all of the inodes
    and recording which blocks are in use.  (This is much like performing an
    [fsck] every time the system boots.)

    **SimpleFS** looks much like the [Unix file system]. Each "file" is
    identified by an integer called an **inode number**. The **inode number**
    is simply an index into the array of **inode** structures that starts in
    block `1`. When a file is created, **SimpleFS** chooses the first available
    **inode** and returns the corresponding **inode number** to the user.  All
    further references to that file are made using the **inode number**. Using
    **SimpleFS** as a foundation, you could easily add another layer of
    software that implements file and directory names.  However, that will not
    be part of this assignment.

    More details about this project and your deliverables are described below.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "file-tree-outline" | embed_icon }}</i> File Systems

    While it may seem that [file systems] are a solved problem with venerable
    examples such as [Ext4], [XFS], and [NTFS], the growth in [big data] and
    the emergence of [SSDs] as the primary storage medium has once again made
    [file systems] a hot topic. Today, we have next-generation file systems in
    the form of [ZFS], [Btrfs], and [AppleFS], which build upon the foundation
    set by previous [file systems].  In this assignment, you will explore the
    core principles about [file systems] and how they work.

    **Note**: This assignment is based heavily on **Project 6: File Systems**
    by [Doug Thain].

    ## Deliverables

    As noted above, you are to work **individually** or in **pairs** to
    implement your simple file system.  For this project, you must use [C] (not
    [C++]) as the implementation language.  Any test scripts or auxillary tools
    can be written in any reasonable scripting language.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "code-tags" | embed_icon }}</i> K.I.S.S.

    While the exact organization of the project code is up to you, keep in mind
    that you will be graded in part on **coding style**, **cleaniness**, and
    **organization**.  This means your code should be consistently formatted,
    not contain any dead code, have reasonable comments, and appropriate naming
    among other things:

    - Break long functions into smaller functions.

    - Make sure each function does one thing and does it well.

    - Abstract, but don't over do it.

    Please refer to these [Coding Style] slides for some tips and guidelines on
    coding style expectations.

    </div>

    ### Disk Emulator

    As noted above, we must implement a simple **disk emulator** on which to
    store your filesystem. This "disk" is actually stored as one big file in
    the file system, so that you can save data in a **disk image** and then
    retrieve it later. In addition, we provide you with some sample disk images
    that you can experiment with to test your filesystem (in the `data`
    directory).  Just like a real disk, the emulator only allows operations on
    entire disk blocks of `4KB` (`BLOCK_SIZE`). You cannot read or write any
    smaller unit than than that. The primary challenge of building a filesystem
    is converting the user's requested operations on arbitrary amounts of data
    into operations on fixed block sizes.

    The interface to the simulated disk is given in `include/sfs/disk.h`:

        :::c
        /* Disk Structure */

        typedef struct Disk Disk;
        struct Disk {
            int     fd;         /* File descriptor of disk image        */
            size_t  blocks;     /* Number of blocks in disk image       */
            size_t  reads;      /* Number of reads to disk image        */
            size_t  writes;     /* Number of writes to disk image       */
        };

        /* Disk Functions */

        Disk *  disk_open(const char *path, size_t blocks);
        void    disk_close(Disk *disk);

        ssize_t disk_read(Disk *disk, size_t block, char *data);
        ssize_t disk_write(Disk *disk, size_t block, char *data);

    Before performing any sort of operation on the disk, you must call
    `disk_open()` method and specify a (real) disk image for storing the disk
    data, and the number of blocks in the simulated disk. If this function is
    called on a disk image that already exists, the contained data will not be
    changed.  When you are done using the disk, the `disk_close` must be called
    to release the file.

    Once the disk is open, you may check `disk->blocks` to discover the number
    of blocks on the disk. As the names suggest, `disk_read()` and
    `disk_write()` read and write one block of data on the disk. Notice that
    the first argument is a block number, so a call to `disk_read(disk, 0,
    data)` reads the first `4KB` of data on the `disk`, and `disk_read(disk, 1,
    data)` reads the next `4KB` block of data on the `disk`. Every time that
    you invoke a read or a write, you must ensure that data points to a full
    `4KB` of memory.

    To implement these operations, the `disk_read` and `disk_write` functions
    internally utilize low-level I/O [system calls] such as [lseek], [read],
    and [write] to operate on the [file descriptor] returned by [open].

    Note that the disk has a few programming conveniences that a real disk
    would not. A real disk is rather finicky -- if you send it invalid
    commands, it will likely crash the system or behave in other strange ways.
    This simulated disk is more "helpful." If you send it an invalid command,
    it will halt the program with an error message. For example, if you attempt
    to read or write a disk block that does not exist, it will throw an
    exception.

    ### File System

    Building off the **disk emulator** described above, you will construct a
    working **file system**.  Take note that we have already constructed the
    interface to the filesystem and provided some skeleton code. The interface
    is given in `include/sfs/fs.h`:

        :::c++
        /* File System Structure */

        typedef struct FileSystem FileSystem;
        struct FileSystem {
            Disk        *disk;                          /* Disk file system is mounted on */
            bool        *free_blocks;                   /* Free block bitmap */
            SuperBlock   meta_data;                     /* File system meta data */
        };

        /* File System Functions */

        void    fs_debug(Disk *disk);
        bool    fs_format(FileSystem *fs, Disk *disk);

        bool    fs_mount(FileSystem *fs, Disk *disk);
        void    fs_unmount(FileSystem *fs);

        ssize_t fs_create(FileSystem *fs);
        bool    fs_remove(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number);
        ssize_t fs_stat(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number);

        ssize_t fs_read(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number, char *data, size_t length, size_t offset);
        ssize_t fs_write(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number, char *data, size_t length, size_t offset);

    The various functions must work as follows:

    > A. `void fs_debug(Disk *disk)`

    This function scans a `disk` and reports on how the inodes and blocks are
    organized. Your output from this method should be similar to the following:

        :::bash
        $ ./bin/sfssh data/image.5 5
        sfs> debug
        SuperBlock:
            magic number is valid
            5 blocks
            1 inode blocks
            128 inodes
        Inode 1:
            size: 965 bytes
            direct blocks: 2

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**, you must print out the information in the `SuperBlock` and the
    information for all the **valid** inodes.  Be sure to print out a list of
    all the **direct blocks** used by the inode, along with any **indirect
    block** (and any **indirect blocks** referenced by the **indirect block**).

    For instance, in the example above, inode `1` has a **file size** of `965`
    bytes and has a **direct block** at location `2` of the underlying **disk**
    device (ie. block `2`).
    </div>

    > B. `bool fs_format(FileSystem *fs, Disk *disk)`

    This function creates a new filesystem on the `disk`, destroying any data
    already present.  It should set aside *ten percent* of the blocks for
    inodes, clear the inode table, and write the superblock.  It must return
    `true` on success, `false` otherwise.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: formatting a filesystem does not cause it to be mounted. Also, an
    attempt to format an already-mounted disk should do nothing and return
    failure.
    </div>

    > C. `bool fs_mount(FileSystem *fs, Disk *disk)`

    This function examines the disk for a filesystem. If one is present, read
    the superblock, build a free block bitmap, and prepare the filesystem for
    use.  Return `true` on success, `false` otherwise.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: a successful mount is a pre-requisite for the remaining calls.
    </div>

    > D. `ssize_t fs_create(FileSystem *fs)`

    This function creates a new **inode** of zero length. On success, return
    the **inode number**.  On failure, return `-1`.

    > E. `bool    fs_remove(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number)`

    This function removes the **inode** indicated by the `inode_number`.  It
    should release all data and indirect blocks assigned to this **inode** and
    return them to the free block map. On success, it returns `true`. On
    failure, it returns `false`.

    > F. `ssize_t fs_stat(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number)`

    This function returns the logical size of the given `inode_number`, in
    bytes.  Note that zero is a valid logical size for an **inode**. On
    failure, it returns `-1`.

    > G. `ssize_t fs_read(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number, char *data, size_t length, size_t offset)`

    This function reads data from a valid **inode**.  It then copies `length`
    bytes from the data blocks of the **inode** into the `data` pointer,
    starting at `offset` in the **inode**.  It should return the total number
    of bytes read. If the given `inode_number` is invalid, or any other error
    is encountered, the method returns `-1`.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: The number of bytes actually read could be smaller than the
    number of bytes requested, perhaps if the end of the **inode** is reached.
    </div>

    > H. `ssize_t fs_write(FileSytem *fs, size_t inode_number, char *data, size_t length, size_t offset)`

    This function writes data to a valid **inode** by copying `length` bytes
    from the pointer `data` into the data blocks of the **inode** starting at
    `offset` bytes.  It will allocate any necessary direct and indirect blocks
    in the process.  Afterwards, it returns the number of bytes actually
    written.  If the given `inode_number` is invalid, or any other error is
    encountered, return `-1`.

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: The number of bytes actually written could be smaller than the

    #### Implementation Notes

    Your job is to implement **SimpleFS** as described above by filling in the
    implementation of both `src/disk.c` and `src/fs.c`.  You do
    not need to change any other code modules. We have already created some
    sample data structures to get you started. These can be found in
    `include/sfs/fs.h`. To begin with, we have defined a number of common
    constants that you will use.  Most of these should be self explanatory:

        :::c
        #define MAGIC_NUMBER       (0xf0f03410)
        #define INODES_PER_BLOCK   (128)
        #define POINTERS_PER_INODE (5)
        #define POINTERS_PER_BLOCK (1024)


    <div class="alert caution-bg" markdown="1">
    Note that `POINTERS_PER_INODE` is the number of direct pointers in each
    inode structure, while `POINTERS_PER_BLOCK` is the number of pointers to be
    found in an indirect block.
    </div>

    The **SuperBlock** and **Inode** structures are easily translated from the
    pictures above:

        :::c
        typedef struct SuperBlock SuperBlock;
        struct SuperBlock {
            uint32_t    magic_number;                   /* File system magic number */
            uint32_t    blocks;                         /* Number of blocks in file system */
            uint32_t    inode_blocks;                   /* Number of blocks reserved for inodes */
            uint32_t    inodes;                         /* Number of inodes in file system */
        };

        typedef struct Inode      Inode;
        struct Inode {
            uint32_t    valid;                          /* Whether or not inode is valid */
            uint32_t    size;                           /* Size of file */
            uint32_t    direct[POINTERS_PER_INODE];     /* Direct pointers */
            uint32_t    indirect;                       /* Indirect pointers */
        };

    Note carefully that many inodes can fit in one disk block. A `4KB` chunk of
    memory containing `128` inodes would look like this:

        :::c
        Inode       Inodes[INODES_PER_BLOCK];

    Each indirect block is just a big array of `1024` integers, each pointing
    to another disk block. So, a `4KB` chunk of memory corresponding to an
    indirect block would look liks this:

        :::c
        uint32_t    Pointers[POINTERS_PER_BLOCK];

    Finally, each data block is just raw binary data used to store the partial
    contents of a file. A data block can be specified as simply an array for
    `4096` bytes:

        :::c
        char        Data[BLOCK_SIZE];

    Because a raw `4KB` disk block can be used to represent four different
    kinds of data: a superblock, a block of `128` inodes, an indirect pointer
    block, or a plain data block,  we can declare a union of each of our four
    different data types.  A union looks like a struct, but forces all of its
    elements to share the same memory space. You can think of a union as
    several different types, all overlaid on top of each other:

        :::c
        typedef union  Block      Block;
        union Block {
            SuperBlock  super;                          /* View block as superblock */
            Inode       inodes[INODES_PER_BLOCK];       /* View block as inode */
            uint32_t    pointers[POINTERS_PER_BLOCK];   /* View block as pointers */
            char        data[BLOCK_SIZE];               /* View block as data */
        };

    Note that the size of an `Block` union will be exactly `4KB`: the size of
    the largest members of the union. To declare a `Block` variable:

        :::c
        Block block;

    Now, we may use `disk_read()` to load in the raw data from block zero. We
    give `disk_read()` the variable `block.data`, which looks like an array of
    characters:

        :::c
        disk_read(disk, 0, block.data);

    But, we may interpret that data as if it were a `SuperBlock` structure by
    accessing the `super` part of the union. For example, to extract the magic
    number of the super block, we might do this:

        :::c
        x = block.super.magic_number;

    On the other hand, suppose that we wanted to load disk block `59`, assume
    that it is an indirect block, and then examine the `4th` pointer. Again, we
    would use `disk_read()` to load the raw data:

        :::c
        disk_read(disk, 59, block.data);

    But then use the `pointers` part of the union like so:

        :::c
        x = block.pointers[3];

    The union offers a convenient way of viewing the same data from multiple
    perspectives. When we load data from the disk, it is just a `4KB` raw
    chunk of data (`block.data`). But, once loaded, the filesystem layer knows
    that this data has some structure. The filesystem layer can view the same
    data from another perspective by choosing another field in the union.

    #### General Advice

    1. **Implement the functions roughly in order**. We have deliberately
    presented the functions of the filesystem interface in order to difficulty.
    Implement `debug`, `format`, and `mount` first. Make sure that you are able
    to access the sample disk images provided. Then, perform creation and
    deletion of inodes without worrying about data blocks. Implement reading
    and test again with disk images. If everything else is working, then
    attempt write.

    2. **Divide and conquer**. Work hard to factor out common actions into
    simple functions. This will dramatically simplify your code. For example,
    you will often need to load and save individual inode structures by number.
    This involves a fiddly little computation to transform an inumber into a
    block number, and so forth. So, make two little methods to do just that:

            :::c
            bool    fs_load_inode(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number, Inode *node);
            bool    fs_save_inode(FileSystem *fs, size_t inode_number, Inode *node);

        Now, everywhere that you need to load or save an inode structure, call
        these functions.

        You may also wish to have functions that help you manage and search the
        free block map:

            :::c
            void    fs_initialize_free_block_bitmap(FileSystem *fs);
            ssize_t fs_allocate_free_block(FileSystem *fs);

        Anytime that find yourself writing very similar code over and over
        again, factor it out into a smaller function.

    3. **Test boundary conditions**. We will certainly test your code by
    probing its boundaries. Make sure that you test and fix boundary conditions
    before handing in. For example, what happens if `fs_create` discovers that
    the inode table is full? It should cleanly return with an error code. It
    certainly should not crash the program or mangle the disk!  Think
    critically about other possible boundary conditions such as the end of a
    file or a full disk.

    4. **Don't worry about performance**. You will be graded on correctness,
    not performance. In fact, during the course of this assignment, you will
    discover that a simple file access can easily erupt into tens or hundreds
    of single disk accesses. Understand why this happens, but don't worry about
    optimization.

    ### Shell

    We have provided for you a simple shell that will be used to exercise your
    filesystem and the simulated disk. When grading your work, we will use the
    shell to test your code, so be sure to test extensively. To use the shell,
    simply run `bin/sfssh` with the name of a disk image, and the number of
    blocks in that image. For example, to use the `image.5` example given
    below, run:

        :::bash
        $ ./bin/sfssh data/image.5 5

    Or, to start with a fresh new disk image, just give a new filename and
    number of blocks:

        :::bash
        $ ./bin/sfssh newdisk 25

    Once the shell starts, you can use the `help` command to list the available
    commands:

        :::bash
        sfs> help
        Commands are:
            format
            mount
            debug
            create
            remove  <inode>
            cat     <inode>
            stat    <inode>
            copyin  <file> <inode>
            copyout <inode> <file>
            help
            quit
            exit

    Most of the commands correspond closely to the filesystem interface. For
    example, `format`, `mount`, `debug`, `create` and `remove` call the
    corresponding methods in the `FileSystem` class. Make sure that you call
    these functions in a sensible order. A filesystem must be formatted once
    before it can be used.  Likewise, it must be mounted before being read or
    written.

    The complex commands are `cat`, `copyin`, and `copyout`. `cat` reads an
    entire file out of the filesystem and displays it on the console, just like
    the Unix command of the same name. `copyin` and `copyout` copy a file from
    the local [Unix file system] into your emulated filesystem. For example, to
        copy the dictionary file into inode `10` in your filesystem, do the
        following:

        :::bash
        sfs> copyin /usr/share/dict/words 10

    Note that these three commands work by making a large number of calls to
    `fs_read()` and `fs_write()` for each file to be copied.

    ### Tests

    To help you verify the correctness of your **SimpleFS** implementation, you
    are provided with the following disk images:

    - [image.5](https://github.com/nd-cse-30341-fa25/project04/raw/master/data/image.5)
    - [image.20](https://github.com/nd-cse-30341-fa25/project04/raw/master/data/image.20)
    - [image.200](https://github.com/nd-cse-30341-fa25/project04/raw/master/data/image.200)

    Likewise, you are also provided a set of unit tests in the `src/tests`
    directory that will test most of the basic functions in the `Disk` and
    `FileSystem` structures:

        :::bash
        $ make test-units       # Run all unit tests
        Running   unit_disk 0
        Running   unit_disk 1
        Running   unit_disk 2
        Running   unit_fs 0
        Running   unit_fs 1
        Running   unit_fs 2
        Running   unit_fs 3

        $ ./bin/unit_fs 0       # Run specific test from FileSystem unit test
        DEBUG tests/unit_fs.c:23:test_00_fs_mount: Check mounting filesystem
        DEBUG tests/unit_fs.c:34:test_00_fs_mount: Check mounting filesystem (already mounted)
        2 disk block reads
        0 disk block writes
        DEBUG tests/unit_fs.c:43:test_00_fs_mount: Check mounting filesystem
        DEBUG tests/unit_fs.c:69:test_00_fs_mount: Check mounting filesystem (already mounted)
        4 disk block reads
        0 disk block writes

    <div class="alert warning-bg" markdown="1">
    **Note**: The `FileSystem` unit test does not check the behavior of the
    `fs_read` and `fs_write` functions.
    </div>

    Additionally, we also provide an extensive suite of test scripts in the
    `bin` directory that will utilize these disk images to test your file
    system.  You can run all the tests by simply doing `make test`:

        :::bash
        $ make test-shell

    The provided test scripts require that the provided disk images are in
    their original state.  Therefore, if you make any modifications to them
    while developing and testing, you should make sure you restore them to
    their original state before attempting the tests.  Since we are using
    [git], you can simply do the following to retrieve the original version of
    a disk image:

    ## Reflection

    To reflect on the project and the concepts involved, you will need to
    create a **group video demonstration** of your software artifact and
    complete an **individual quiz** (*each member will submit their own answers
    to their own private assignments repository*).

    ### Video Demonstration

    As part of your grade, your group will need to create a video that
    demonstrates and discusses the following:

    1. Your **library** passing the automated tests.

    2.  <div class="flex-col">

        Explain with visuals (ie. diagrams, graphics, code, etc.) what happens
        when a user does the following in the context of typical [Unix file
        system]:

            :::c
            int fd = open("path.txt", O_RDONLY);
            char buffer[BUFSIZ];

            while (read(fd, buffer, BUFSIZ) > 0) {
                ...
            }

            close(fd);

        Be sure to describe what happens at the disk level and file system
        level and what structures are utilized by the operating system kernel.

        </div>

    3. Any **errata, quirks, or unresolved issues** in your project.

    4. What you **learned** by doing this project.

    The video should include narration to describe what is being presented and
    should cover the requirements enumerated above. It should be no longer than
    `5` minutes.

    Please upload the video to either [YouTube] or [Google Drive] and provide a
    link to it in your `README.md`.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "git" | embed_icon }}</i> Commit History

    To encourage you to work on the project **regularly** (rather than leaving
    it until the last second) and to practice performing **incremental
    development**, part of your grade will be based on whether or not you have
    regular and reasonably sized commits in your [git] log.

    That is, you will **lose** a point if you commit everything at once near
    the project deadline.

    ### <i class="icon icon-medium">{{ "bug" | embed_icon }}</i> Error Handling

    In addition to meeting the functional requirements of the project (as
    described above), your program **must not exhibit any memory leaks** or
    **invalid memory accesses** as would be detected by [Valgrind].

    Additionally, because [system calls] can fail, your program must implement
    **robust error handling** and ensure your code checks the status of [system
    calls] when reasonable.

    Moreover, you code must compile **without any warnings** (and `-Wall` must
    be one of the `CFLAGS`).
